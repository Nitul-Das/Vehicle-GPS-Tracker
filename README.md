API and Data Flow:

Vehicle data is fetched from:

If the API fails, mock data is used as fallback

Each vehicle object contains:
id, name, type, position (lat, lng), speed, status, driver, fuel, lastUpdate

Data updates every 10 seconds using setInterval

Filtering is applied based on selected ID, speed range, and status

UI Flow:

App loads with a loading screen

Fetches initial vehicle data

Displays sidebar with filters and stats

Shows live map with markers

Every 10 seconds, data is refreshed

Countdown shows remaining seconds for next update

User can interact with markers and filters
